# 3 Adapters passed into PFSense VM via VirtualBox

Adapter 1*: WAN | Assigned IP-Address via DHCP from our ISP

Adapter 2**: LAN | Assigned a Static IP-Address  of: 192.168.5.1 in Pfsense

Adapter 3***: OPT | Assigned a Static IP Address of: 192.168.10.1 in Pfsense

# PFSense Assignments/DHCP Configuration


Adapter 1* : WAN (em0) | Ipv4 Configuration Type = DHCP | Enabled
	
	We want WAN (em0) to receive an address from our ISP via DHCP which was: 10.0.2.15/24
	Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

Adapter 2** : LAN (em0) | Ipv4 Configuration Type = Static | Enabled
	
	We want LAN (em1) to be a static ip address of: 192.168.1.1/24
	Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

	DHCP Config:
	In networking, it is typical to have other networking hardware such as access points, unmanaged/managed Switches which will need addressing that 
	we don't ever want to change so for these network appliances we can use any address from: 192.168.1.2 - 192.168.1.9 | 7 Devices that have
	static ip addressing for ease of management as these addresses will be purposely left out of our DHCP Address pool.

	Subnet: 192.168.1.0
	Subnet range: 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.254
	Address pool range: 192.168.1.10 - 192.168.1.254
	Gateway: 192.168.1.1

Adapter 3** : OFFICE (em1) | Ipv4 Configuration Type = Static | Enabled

	NOTE: OPT was renamed to OFFICE in PFSense and a VLAN named OFFICE was assigned to this interface (em1) 
	
	We want LAN (em1) to be a static ip address of: 192.168.5.1/24
	Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
